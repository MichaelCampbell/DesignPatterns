**Single var Pattern**
==================
----------
Description
-----------
Use one var statement and declare multiple variables

Benefits
--------
1) Provides a single place to look for all the local variables needed by the function
2) Prevents logical errors when a variable is used before it's defined
3) Helps you remember to declare variables and therefore minimize globals
4) Is less code (to type and to transfer over the wire)
